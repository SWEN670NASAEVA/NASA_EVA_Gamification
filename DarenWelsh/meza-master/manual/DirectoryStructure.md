This is an overview of the directory structure used by a meza server. This does not include every single file, but attempts to list out directories and files used by the meza application.

Info required: which files exist on which server types? Currently this is mostly focused on monolithic installations, where the controller and all applications (MariaDB, Elasticsearch, MediaWiki, etc) are on the same server.

## Glossary

There are several terms in this document which may be described in the [Glossary](Glossary.md).

## Major directories

The five major directories are:

1. `/opt/meza`: The meza application. Only modified when developing for or upgrading meza version
2. `/opt/conf-meza`: meza configuration. Modified by sysadmins when making configuration changes.
3. `/opt/data-meza`: storage of meza information. Modified anytime wiki users do anything on the site.
4. `/opt/.deploy-meza`: Files deployed by the meza application. Sysadmins don't need to touch this. Instead, modify `/opt/meza` or `/opt/conf-meza` and re-deploy.
5. `/opt/htdocs`: The webserver root. Deployed just like `/opt/.deploy-meza`.

## `/opt/meza`

Meza application directory. This should never change except if you upgrade meza (or you're doing development for the meza application itself). This only exists on the controller.

## `/opt/conf-meza`

Location of configuration setup for meza. This is split into `secret` and `public` config. Secret config is intended for sensitive info like passwords. It also houses your `hosts` file which declares which servers have which components installed (e.g. Parsoid is installed on `192.168.56.80`). The `hosts` file may or may not be considered sensitive, but it resides in `secret` nonetheless. Some non-sensitive items may be more convenient to put in `secret`. These include things like `enable_wiki_emails`, which you may only want set to `true` on your production setup and no others. Since the `hosts` file resides in `secret` those environment-specific settings may be better to keep in `secret`.

Additionally, the user `meza-ansible` is used by meza to perform most actions. Some other actions are performed by the `alt-meza-ansible` user. However, we don't create these users in `/home` due to possible conflicts with other user systems. Ref #727.

* `public`:
  * `MezaLocalExtensions.yml`: Use to define extra extensions for your meza installation
  * `public.yml`: MAIN CONFIGURATION VARIABLES FILE!
  * `postLocalSettings.d/`:

  * `wikis`:
    * `demo`: this "demo" is known as the wiki ID
      * `favicon.ico`: favicon
      * `logo.png`: logo

      * `preLocalSettings.d`:
        * `base.php`:
        * (`.php` files here loaded at beginning of LocalSettings.php for this wiki only)
    * (more wikis with same format as above)

## `/opt/data-meza`

Data storage for meza. This is basically any information generated by using meza, including MariaDB (MySQL) database info, files uploaded by users, logs from meza commands (logs from Apache, HAProxy, system logs, etc are kept in their standard CentOS/RHEL locations), temp files, and backups from running `meza backup` command.

* `backups`: backups directory populated from running `meza backup <environment>`

      * `20170523123216_wiki.sql`: database backup from specified timestamp
      * `uploads/`: backup of uploads directory

    * (wikis in production)

  * (more wikis uploads/ directories)
* `uploads-gluster`: used instead of `uploads` if multiple app-servers used. File system distributed between app-servers.

## `/opt/.deploy-meza`

This directory is a hidden directory (e.g. starts with a period) because it really shouldn't be modified directly. When the `meza deploy` command is run this directory is set based upon the config set in `/opt/conf-meza`.

* `config.php`: PHP config variable file written based off defaults, secret and public config
* `config.sh`: Bash config variable file written based off defaults, secret and public config

* `smw-rebuild-all.sh`: Rebuild SMW data for all wikis. Deployed by `role:mediawiki`
* `public`: A copy of /opt/conf-meza/public, but present on all app-servers, as opposed to `/opt/conf-meza` which is only present on the controller
  * `MezaLocalExtensions.yml`: present but not used within .deploy-meza (controller only)
  * `postLocalSettings.d`: gives app servers access to these files
  * `preLocalSettings.d`: gives app servers acces to these files

## `/opt/htdocs`

This directory is similar to `/opt/.deploy-meza` in that it is a deployed directory: It is put in place on app servers by the meza application. In fact, it was considered to be placed at `/opt/.deploy-meza/htdocs` but due to its larger significance as the web root it seemed like it should have its own directory.

* `index.php`: entrypoint for landing page
* `mediawiki`: mediawiki application. many items not shown below
  * `extensions/`: where extensions are installed (by the meza application; sysadmins do not need to touch this)

    * `nv.d3.js`:
    * `server-performance.nvd3.js`:
  * `space.php`: disk space usage
* `WikiBlender`: landing page repo. Perhaps should be rolled into meza
* `wikis`:
  * `demo`: directory that symlinks to deployed config, to make logo/favicon web accessible
    * `config`: symlink to `/opt/.deploy-meza/public/wikis/demo` (FIXME #709: Security implications)
  * (more wikis)
