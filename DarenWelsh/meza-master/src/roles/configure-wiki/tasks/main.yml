# inputs:
#   wiki_id
#   wiki_name
#
# all this role needs to do is put a directory named whatever wiki_id is at
# /opt/conf-meza/public/wikis/<wiki_id>
#
# This role DOES NOT actually deploy the wiki to app servers or database
# servers. It simply puts it into configuration. Subsequently it can be
# deployed.
#
# This directory needs to have some minimum requirements:
#   logo.png (is .jpg also allowed?)
#   original.png (is .jpg also allowed? Is this really required?)
#   favicon.ico
#   preLocalSettings.php
#   postLocalSettings.php
