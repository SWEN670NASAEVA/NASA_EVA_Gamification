# DEPLOY VARS
#
# Variables set in secret config that are deployed to `/opt/.deploy-meza` to
# config.sh and config.php. This allows any custom variable to be available to
# all aspects of meza, but the functionality was specifically added to allow
# custom secret variables to be used in MediaWiki. For example, if an extension
# is added that requires a configuration variable set to something sensitive,
# putting that information in MezaLocalExtensions.yml or postLocalSettings.php
# puts the info in public config.
